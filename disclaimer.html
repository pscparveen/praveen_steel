                <h3>2. Steel Weight Calculator Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>The steel weight calculator tool provided on this website is designed to offer estimated values based on standard geometric formulas and user-provided input dimensions. These calculations are intended as rough estimation tools only.</p>
                <p><strong>Important Limitations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actual weight may vary due to grade-specific density variations, rolling tolerances, and machining allowances</li>
                    <li>The calculator uses a standard steel density of 7.85 g/cm³ which may differ for specific alloy compositions</li>
                    <li>Manufacturing processes and heat treatment conditions can affect final weight</li>
                    <li>Measurement errors and rounding approximations may impact results</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Users are solely responsible for independent verification of all calculations before procurement, fabrication, structural application, or making any commercial commitments. For critical applications, always consult with qualified engineers and verify weights through physical weighing.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Final acceptance of material must rely on the original Mill Test Certificate (MTC) and associated test reports for the supplied material. Always request and verify MTCs before use in critical applications.</p>
                
                <p class="mt-3"><strong>Mechanical Properties:</strong> Mechanical property values presented on this website represent typical or standard-grade references. Actual properties can vary significantly based on:</p>
